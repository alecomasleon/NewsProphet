    "body": "It was an unforgettable evening of celebration, networking and digital inspiration at Mashable's SmartBash at CES in Las Vegas. Presented by LG, the SmartBash brought partying to a new level with the company's latest cutting edge products and, of course, specialty cocktails like the Smartini.\nMashable's community came together to network and talk about the innovations at CES.\nAttendees spent time looking at the new LG 3D smart TVs and the Super-Capacity Smart French Door Refrigerator, which features smart functions like food management and a Google calendar.\nThe night was a blast and, as always, Mashable loved spending time with our community in Las Vegas.\nTo see photos from SmartBash, check out the gallery below.
